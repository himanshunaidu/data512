# DATA 512 Homework 1: Wikipedia Rare Disease Article Traffic Analysis

## Project Goal

The goal of this project is to collect, analyze, and publish monthly article traffic data for a set of Wikipedia pages related to rare diseases. The data spans from July 2015 to September 2024, and is gathered from the Wikimedia Analytics Pageviews API. The dataset allows for an analysis of trends in desktop and mobile traffic across various articles over time.

The purpose of this project is also to follow best practices for open scientific research, ensuring reproducibility through transparent documentation, data accessibility, and adherence to licensing standards.

The code for the project is present in the Jupyter notebook [wp_rare_disease_article_views.ipynb](wp_rare_disease_article_views.ipynb)

## API Documentation

The data is acquired using the [Wikimedia Analytics Pageviews API](https://doc.wikimedia.org/generated-data-platform/aqs/analytics-api/reference/page-views.html). The API documentation provides details on how to make requests for pageview data and includes parameters for specifying the time range, article titles, and access type (e.g., mobile, desktop).

## Generated Files

The code generates several data files during its execution.

  ]
}
```


### Plot Files

The plot files are all the plots generated by the [Jupyter notebook](wp_rare_disease_article_views.ipynb)
